# Week 19 Challenge - PWA Budget Tracker

## Description

This is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) for a budget tracker. It's designed to keep track of deposits and expenses, both online and offline, perfect for the traveling user.

## User Story

As an avid traveler, I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection, so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a budget tracker without an internet connection:

- **Offline Tracking:** When the user inputs an expense or deposit, they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit.
- **Reestablished Connection:** When the user reestablishes an internet connection, the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated.

This PWA ensures that you can track your budget no matter where you are or what kind of internet connection you have.
